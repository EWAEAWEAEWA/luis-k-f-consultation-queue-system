this is our project for comsci 2nd yr subject operating systems. write it in java using mvc, take it slow, step by step:
Online Consultation Appointment Queue (FIFO)
Algorithm Used: First-In–First-Out (FIFO)


Users: Students, professors, school counselors


Program Overview
A queue-based system that allows students to book online consultations with teachers. Students can only appoint with their professors from their subjects, but can appoint with any counselors.


Ensures fair appointment scheduling.


Features & Innovations
Live Queue Status Display: Shows estimated waiting time for each student.


Time-Limited Slots: Prevents students from monopolizing consultation hours.


Multiple Queue Management: Different professors/counselors can have separate queues.


Reschedule & Cancellation Option: Frees up slots if students cancel.


Priority Queueing: Professors/counselors can mark certain students as high-priority, allowing urgent or special cases to move ahead in the queue.


Smart Notifications & Alerts: Users receive reminders for upcoming consultations, updates for cancellations, and rescheduling notifications.


User Login & Role-Based Access: Secure login system that shows different features and interface layouts based on the user’s role (student, professor, or counselor).

important: make it as simple as possible, do not overcomplicate, while achieving the necessary features. the purpose of this project is not to show a robust system, but only to show a functional system with algorithms, mainly first in first out, but with other algorithms such as scheduling or priority, depending on the features i listed as you can see.
